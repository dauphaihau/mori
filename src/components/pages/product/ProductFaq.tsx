    title: 'How do I know if death has occurred?',
    content: 'When a person is close to death you may notice something called Cheyne-Stokes breathing. This is an irregular breathing pattern which means there can be at first an increased breathing pattern and then long gaps between breaths. There can be a period of apnea when breating stops altogether, leading you to think the person has died, only for them to take another breath.\n' +
      'If you want to be really certain: Look for movement in the chest. Can you feel a pulse in their wrist or neck? Does a mirror mist over if held to the mouth or nose? Does the person respond to a physical stimulus? These are reliable indicators if you are with someone at the end of their life, perhaps at home.'

    title: 'Can I use a local church if I am not religious?',
    content: 'While providing a beautiful and convenient venue, a service in a church is a religious one, and is led by a minister. If a minister other than ‘the incumbent’ is wanted, permission must be granted by the current minister. Sometimes a ‘multi-faith’ minister will be allowed to hold the service – or part of the service – in the church. Some ministers are understanding of the fact that your family might prefer a service that is ‘light’ on religion – but prayers and liturgical content will be part of the service.'

    title: 'Keeping the person\'s body at home\n',
    content: 'A person’s body may be safely kept at home in cool conditions for a couple of days – more in colder conditions. You may want reassurance or advice from a funeral director, but you can close the person’s eyes, put a small towel rolled under the chin, or a scarf around the chin and head for a few hours to keep the mouth closed (teeth in!) Turn off radiators, keep the room shaded (curtains closed) and as cool as possible.  You can use a fan if you wish. Intro five frozen ice blocks (the type used for a picnic), each wrapped in a tea towel, will help cool the body quicker and keep it cool, so the person can stay at home for longer. Rotate the blocks every few hours as needed. ' +
      'Lavender oil in a burner helps too. The Natural Death Centre has great advice on how to care for a body at home.'

  {
    title: 'How soon can the funeral take place?\n',
    content: 'It is best to allow seven to ten days for a cremation; five days does not allow for unforeseen delays, but can be done. In particular circumstances – as required by certain religious faiths, burial can take place within 24 hours of death.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Can I assist with the washing and dressing?\n',
    content: ' Yes, of course.We will provide warm water, towels, essential oils, and a quiet space.We can help, advise or let the family / friends present do it on their own.\n'

  {
    title: 'Are the ashes toxic?',
    content: 'No, the ashes are inert. They contain dry calcium phosphates with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium; a relatively small amount of carbon may remain as carbonate.'
